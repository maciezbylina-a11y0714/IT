I've created a git repository with all your files at:
- **Location:** `$env:TEMP\it-clone` (C:\Users\aaa\AppData\Local\Temp\it-clone)

## 🚀 Quick Steps to Push (Choose One Method)

### Method 1: Use the Cloned Repository (Easiest)

2. **Click:** `File` → `Add Local Repository`
3. **Browse to:** `C:\Users\aaa\AppData\Local\Temp\it-clone`
4. **Select the folder** and click "Add Repository"
5. **GitHub Desktop will show:** The repository is connected
6. **Click:** `Repository` → `Push` (or the "Push origin" button)
7. **Done!** Your files will be uploaded to GitHub

### Method 2: Clone Fresh and Copy Files

1. **Open GitHub Desktop**
2. **Click:** `File` → `Clone Repository`
3. **URL tab:** Enter `https://github.com/maciezbylina-a11y0714/IT.git`
4. **Choose a location** (e.g., `E:\IT\IT-GitHub`)
5. **Click Clone**
6. **Copy ALL files** from `E:\IT\IT-Company-Website-main` 
7. **Paste them** into the cloned folder (`E:\IT\IT-GitHub`)

### Method 3: Use Command Line (If Method 1 Works)

If the repository at `$env:TEMP\it-clone` is accessible:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\aaa\AppData\Local\Temp\it-clone
git push -u origin main
```
